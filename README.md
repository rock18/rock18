Hi I'm Rock and I'm currently studying Mathematics and Computer Science in the National Open University of Nigeria.

I have always wanted to use technology to improve learning. on the side, I am working on a project that uses Artificial intelligence and augmented reality to solve the problem of object visualization and interaction with the environment. some of my interests include visualizing mathematical concepts and problems.

I love efficient code that solves complex problems and so far I have been working on backend stuff and also embedded technology especially cortex-m microcontrollers

My best-known work includes an android app that displays covid-19 heatmap using data from the WHO Github repo. Although not on Playstore due to Google's Playstore policies for Covid-19 apps.

In the past 5 years, I have worked at least with the following programming language: C/C++, Python, Kotlin, Golang, Javascript, Java
